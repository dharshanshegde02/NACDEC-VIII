## Conceptual Design and Sizing of a Supersonic Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (SUCAV)

- Conducted a comprehensive trade study on various UCAV and 5th-generation stealth aircraft configurations to establish the optimal design baseline for mission objectives.
- Defined key performance drivers and optimized the vehicle's configuration using formal decision-making methods, including the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Pugh Matrix.
- Executed detailed weight estimations and fuel fraction calculations across a complete multi-phase mission profile, encompassing takeoff, subsonic/supersonic cruise, strike, and landing.
- Developed the aircraft's flight envelope by constructing a V-n diagram to define operational limits, and performed structural analysis on the wing, including material selection, to ensure airframe integrity.
